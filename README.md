**AI-Powered Compliance Co-Pilot for Pharmacies**  
Automate regulatory checks, prescription verification, and high-risk flagging with modular Agentic AI.

## ðŸš€ Overview

RxSentinel is a modular Agentic AI platform that enhances pharmacy operations by automating:

- âœ… Prescription typing validation
- âœ… DEA and license verification
- âœ… State-specific shipping compliance
- âœ… High-dose monitoring and BUD enforcement
- âœ… Controlled substance refill timing
- âœ… Missing documentation (ECG, CDS) alerts
- âœ… Tech notifications and pharmacist escalation
- âœ… Human feedback + RLHF for continuous learning

Built to integrate with legacy systems like **Life File**, **QS/1**, and **PioneerRx**, RxSentinel brings intelligent decision support without requiring a complete software replacement.
